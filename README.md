# CarVilla 🚗🏁  

### A Practice Car Dealership Website  

CarVilla is a **practice project** designed to showcase a modern and stylish car dealership website. This website is **not** a real dealership, and none of the prices, details, or cars listed are for sale.  

## 🛠️ About This Project  
This project was created as a learning experience to improve my web development skills. It features:  
- A **modern UI** with a clean and professional design.  
- A **car listing section** displaying featured and new cars.  
- A **search and filter feature** for car selection.  
- A **testimonials section** for a realistic dealership feel.
